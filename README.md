# AMI-homecharger
Fancy and complicated way to charge a Citröen AMI


Motivation:
  Citröen AMI only charges though a simple Schuko plug into European 230V wall socket.
  
  
Using a simple shelly module to switch on Live line does not activate charging mode

Since we're assuming there is active Live + Neutral + Earth detection, additional hardware is needed, hence this project is born
